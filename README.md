# connegp-tests

**SOLVE**:
- One (potential) code change for pyldapi to discuss - adding rel=”canonical” and rel=”default” to link in header 
- Test R.1.2.d requires update to be client sends requests with q=x etc.
- How to implement test for “ref2_2_c”. Specification says API “SHOULD” use IANA mediatypes, not must. Present a warning but pass the test?
- Not clear if ref2_4_a and ref2_4_b should use format= instead of profile= as per example in specification
- ref3_2_d - not sure the test should be checking against a static list of mediatypes
